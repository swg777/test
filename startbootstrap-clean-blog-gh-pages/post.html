            <p>During almost two years of my life, I had the incredible opportunity to live in Argentina.
                Before traveling there, I hadn't left the country before. Living in Argentina really opened
                my eyes to the beauty of different cultures and how distinct life is in other places around
                the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here are some of the biggest things that I found to be different and also appreciate while living in Argentina.
            </p>

            <ol>
                <li id="lang" class="bold">Language
                    <ul>
                        <li><B>Spanish</B> - The main language spoken in Argentina is Spanish. Spanish is one of the most spoken languages around the world and is especially prominent in South America.</li>
                        <li><b>European Influence</b> - If you speak Spanish, you will notice that the Spanish of Argentina is much different from the Spanish that you'd hear in other Spanish speaking countries. Because of European influence that the immigrants to Argentina brought with them, they almost sound like they speak Italian. In fact, when they speak, they use a lot of hand gestures that are reminicent of italian culture. Another distinguishing trait of argentinian Spanish is the interesting pronounciation of the letters "y" and "ll". In practically every other Spanish speaking country, apart from Argentina and Uruguay (la provincia rebelde), all other countries pronounce it as if it were the "y" in the word "yellow". However, in Argentina and the provincia rebelde, these letters sound like a "sh" rather than the typical "y" sound.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                <p style="color: black;">Below is a good example of what their Spanish sounds like. Here's an example taken from the celebration after Argentina won the World Cup.</p>

                <br><br>
                <li id="food" class="bold"><b>Food</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Asado</b> - One of the most common and popular foods in Argentina is the meat served during an "asado". The argentinian asado is Argentian's equivalent of the american barbecue. What distinguishes there "asado" from the american barbecue is the fact that because of the quality of the meat that is used, very few seasonings are used to add flavor. This is something I didn't realize until somebody I was talking to made note of it. What's incredible is that the meat still tastes amazing and the quality is focused on much more than the seasoning used to cover it up.</li>
                        <li><b>Mate</b> - Another incredibly popular part of the argentinian food culture is there consumption of a drink called "mate" or "yerba mate". This interesting drink is made by putting yerba leaves into a dried gourd or wooden cup and then inserting a metal straw with a filter on the end called a "bombilla". Once it's in place, the "sebador" or server of the mate proceeds to pour hot water where the bombilla is located.</li>
                        <li><b>Empanadas</b> - These are not only another one of the most popular foods found in Argentina, but also one of the most convenient. An empanada is basically made by taking a wrap and stuffing it with any kind of filling. In Argentina, this is usually carne picada (ground beef), ham and cheese or chicken. After the filling is put into the wrap, the wrap is then folded to look like a semi circle and then either deep fried or cooked in the oven. The result is a delicious and very convenient hand-eaten food.</li>
                        <li><b>Facturas</b> - This food is one of the most common sweets that are consumed by Argentinians. They are basically Argentina’s equivalent of America’s donut. They are often eaten at breakfast or to accompany their mate. Facturas are baked pastries that are often covered in a glaze of sugar or dulce de leche, a caramel like sauce.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li id="customs" class="bold"><b>Customs</b>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Kisses</b> - Unlike the United States, one of the most common ways to greet somebody in Argentina is by kissing them on the cheek. This is another one of those European customs that they brought with them over to South America. At first, it is interesting to see people who don’t know each other kiss each other on the cheek but after a while, it becomes an endearing way to greet somebody.</li>
                        <li><b>Mate</b> - Mate in and of itself is a whole other part of their culture. At first glance, it might just look like their version of green tea. However, with a closer look we can see that mate is actually a lot more than that. It is consumed anywhere from 2 to 4 times a day by almost 90% of all Argentinians. What makes mate such a big part of their culture is the fact that it is not meant to just drink but to stimulate conversation. I got to know a few Argentinians that would not even drink it unless they were with somebody else. The custom of Argentina is to drink from the bombilla, and then pass it onto the next person after you fill it up. This continues to happen with everybody in the room. It is a way to connect more intimately with those that you were talking to.</li>
                        <li><b>Meals</b> - Another interesting custom that they have is the timing in which they eat their food. Here in the United States it is normal to wake up and eat a large breakfast, have a small lunch afterwards, and around 6 PM we tend to eat dinner. In Argentina, this is very different. For breakfast, they usually just drink mate with some crackers or facturas. Later at lunch is when they eat the most food of the day. Afterwards they have something called a “merienda” which is basically between lunch and dinner. This can also be had between breakfast and lunch like a “brunch” here in the United States. Finally, most Argentinians eat dinner around 9 or 10 pm. This is because half-way through the day it is common to take a “siesta” or nap and resume working until late at night.</li>
